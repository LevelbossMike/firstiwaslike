Everyone that has tried to achieve something with programming a computer
knows the feeling when you want to do something with or you have deal with a technology that is new to you. Most of the time you have to get your head around a new way of thinking, a new tool, an unfamiliar API, code that someone else has written or a new programming syntax and at first most likely your feelings come close to the feeling the kitten on the left expresses in the picture below.

![First I was like?! Then I loled!](http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/2758/firstiwaslike.jpg "First I was like?!")

But after some time occupying yourself with the new unknown most of the
time you get it. And you're like „Oh Yeah! LOL!“. Like the kitten on the
right.
 

This blog is about my „Oh Yeah! LOL!“-moments. Have fun!
